#Building a radically open editorial process
============

Imagine what newsrooms and journalistic organizations could look like—and what we could accomplish—if we opened up the editorial process and not just the final product. In this session, we'll work together to brainstorm ways to fundamentally shift journalism's one-sided relationship with its readers. Together, we'll identify specific areas where journalistic organizations could open their process, work more transparently, or loop readers into the lifecycle of a story. Then we'll start designing tools to make those things possible.
